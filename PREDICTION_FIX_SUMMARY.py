PREDICTION ACCURACY FIX - Summary
==================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
-------------------
The model was not predicting accurately because the preprocessing in `process_uploaded_data()` 
in app.py DID NOT MATCH the preprocessing used during training in `preprocess.py`.

KEY DIFFERENCES FIXED:
----------------------

1. **academic_score formula**:
   - WRONG (in old app.py): (cgpa/10)*0.4 + (attendance/100)*0.3 + (assignments/100)*0.3
   - CORRECT (preprocess.py): (cgpa/10*50) + (attendance/100*30) + (assignments/60*20)

2. **engagement_score formula**:
   - WRONG (in old app.py): (activities/2)*0.3 + (study_hours/40)*0.4 + (projects/10)*0.3
   - CORRECT (preprocess.py): (activities*2) + (projects*3) + (sports_binary*5)

3. **Risk indicator thresholds**:
   - low_attendance: <70 (not <75)
   - low_cgpa: <5.0 (not <6.0)
   - high_failures: >3 (not >=2)
   - low_study_hours: <10 (not <15)

4. **Label encoders**:
   - WRONG: Creating new LabelEncoder().fit_transform() for each upload
   - CORRECT: Load saved encoders from 'label_encoders.pkl' and use .transform()
   - Handle unseen categories by mapping to known defaults ('Other', 'UNKNOWN', 'Unknown')

5. **Data standardization**:
   - Must match exact string replacements:
     - Gender: 'M' → 'Male', 'FEMALE' → 'Female', 'NA'/'NAN' → 'Other'
     - Scholarship: 'Y' → 'Yes', 'N'/'NOPE'/'NAN' → 'No'
     - Sports: 'Y' → 'Yes', 'N'/'NAN' → 'No'

CHANGES MADE:
-------------
✅ Updated `process_uploaded_data()` in app.py to use EXACT preprocessing from preprocess.py
✅ Changed academic_score formula to match training
✅ Changed engagement_score formula to match training
✅ Fixed all risk indicator thresholds
✅ Added logic to load and use saved label_encoders.pkl
✅ Added handling for unseen categories in categorical variables

HOW TO VERIFY:
--------------
1. Upload your raw "Dataset - Dataset.csv" file (without dropout column)
2. System will apply preprocessing and predict dropout risk
3. Predictions should now be accurate based on the trained model

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- The model was trained with SMOTE (class balancing), so it may predict more "at risk" students
- Prediction accuracy depends on how similar the new data is to the training data
- If new data has very different distributions, consider retraining the model

MODEL INFO:
-----------
- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Features: 21 engineered features
- Training accuracy: Check `reports/figures/` for performance metrics
- Saved in: models/student_model.pkl

NEXT STEPS IF ACCURACY IS STILL LOW:
-------------------------------------
1. Retrain the model by running: `python train_model.py`
2. This will use the preprocessed data in `data/processed/cleaned_student_data.csv`
3. New model will be saved to `models/student_model.pkl`
4. Restart the Streamlit app
