# üîß PREDICTION ACCURACY FIX - COMPLETE

## Problem Summary
Your student risk prediction model was not predicting accurately when you uploaded new data files. The root cause was **inconsistent preprocessing** between training and prediction.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue
The `process_uploaded_data()` function in `app.py` was using **DIFFERENT formulas** and **thresholds** than those used during model training in `preprocess.py`. This caused the model to receive completely different feature values, leading to inaccurate predictions.

### Specific Differences Found

#### 1. Academic Score Formula ‚ùå
- **Training (preprocess.py):** `(cgpa/10*50) + (attendance/100*30) + (assignments/60*20)`
- **Prediction (OLD app.py):** `(cgpa/10)*0.4 + (attendance/100)*0.3 + (assignments/100)*0.3`
- **Impact:** Scores differed by ~60 points! (e.g., 60.17 vs 0.54)

#### 2. Engagement Score Formula ‚ùå
- **Training (preprocess.py):** `(activities*2) + (projects*3) + (sports*5)`
- **Prediction (OLD app.py):** `(activities/2)*0.3 + (study_hours/40)*0.4 + (projects/10)*0.3`
- **Impact:** Scores differed by ~9 points! (e.g., 10.0 vs 0.97)

#### 3. Risk Indicator Thresholds ‚ùå
| Indicator | Training (preprocess.py) | OLD app.py | Fixed |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------|-------|
| low_attendance | < 70 | < 75 | ‚úÖ |
| low_cgpa | < 5.0 | < 6.0 | ‚úÖ |
| high_failures | > 3 | >= 2 | ‚úÖ |
| low_study_hours | < 10 | < 15 | ‚úÖ |

#### 4. Label Encoding ‚ùå
- **Training:** Used `LabelEncoder().fit()` on training data, saved to `label_encoders.pkl`
- **Prediction (OLD):** Created NEW encoders with `fit_transform()` on each upload
- **Problem:** Different categories got different numeric codes
- **Impact:** Categorical variables (gender, department, parental_education) were encoded differently

#### 5. Data Standardization ‚ùå
- **Inconsistent string replacements** for categories like 'M' ‚Üí 'Male', 'Y' ‚Üí 'Yes', etc.

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### File: `app.py`
Updated `process_uploaded_data()` function (lines ~470-540) to:

1. **Match exact preprocessing formulas from `preprocess.py`:**
   ```python
   # Academic score - EXACT formula
   df['academic_score'] = (df['cgpa'] / 10 * 50) + (df['attendance_rate'] / 100 * 30) + (df['assignments_submitted'] / 60 * 20)
   
   # Engagement score - EXACT formula
   df['engagement_score'] = (df['total_activities'] * 2) + (df['projects_completed'] * 3) + (df['sports_binary'] * 5)
   ```

2. **Use correct risk indicator thresholds:**
   ```python
   df['low_attendance'] = (df['attendance_rate'] < 70).astype(int)   # was <75
   df['low_cgpa'] = (df['cgpa'] < 5.0).astype(int)                   # was <6.0
   df['high_failures'] = (df['past_failures'] > 3).astype(int)       # was >=2
   df['low_study_hours'] = (df['study_hours_per_week'] < 10).astype(int)  # was <15
   ```

3. **Load and use saved label encoders:**
   ```python
   label_encoders = joblib.load(MODEL_DIR / 'label_encoders.pkl')
   df['gender_encoded'] = label_encoders['gender'].transform(df['gender'])
   # ... (with handling for unseen categories)
   ```

4. **Match exact data standardization:**
   ```python
   df['gender'] = df['gender'].str.upper().replace({'M': 'Male', 'FEMALE': 'Female', 'NA': 'Other'})
   df['scholarship'] = df['scholarship'].str.upper().replace({'Y': 'Yes', 'N': 'No', 'NOPE': 'No'})
   # ... etc
   ```

## üìä Verification

Run the comparison script to see the difference:
```bash
python formula_comparison.py
```

This shows that the old formulas produced:
- Academic score: 0.54 (WRONG) vs 60.17 (CORRECT) ‚Üí **60 point difference!**
- Engagement score: 0.97 (WRONG) vs 10.0 (CORRECT) ‚Üí **9 point difference!**

## üéØ How to Use Now

### Upload New Data
1. Go to the "Students" page in your Streamlit app
2. Upload a CSV or Excel file with these columns:
   - `student_id`, `gender`, `department`, `scholarship`, `parental_education`
   - `extra_curricular`, `age`, `cgpa`, `attendance_rate`, `family_income`
   - `past_failures`, `study_hours_per_week`, `assignments_submitted`
   - `projects_completed`, `sports_participation`
   
3. **Do NOT include** the `dropout` column (that's what we're predicting!)

4. Click "Process File" and the system will:
   - Apply the EXACT same preprocessing as training
   - Use the saved Random Forest model
   - Generate accurate predictions

### Expected Results
- Predictions should now match the model's learned patterns
- Statistics will show realistic risk distribution (~28% at risk based on training data)
- Individual student risk scores should align with their actual characteristics

## üîç If Predictions Still Seem Off

### Possible Reasons:
1. **Different data distribution** - Your new data might be very different from training data
2. **Model needs retraining** - If using very different time period or student population

### Solution:
Retrain the model with your latest data:
```bash
# 1. Place your labeled data (with dropout column) in data/raw/
# 2. Run preprocessing
python preprocess.py

# 3. Train new model
python train_model.py

# 4. Restart Streamlit
streamlit run app.py
```

## üìù Key Takeaway

**Feature engineering must be IDENTICAL between training and prediction!**

Even small formula differences cause huge impacts on model predictions. Always ensure:
- ‚úÖ Same formulas
- ‚úÖ Same thresholds
- ‚úÖ Same encoders
- ‚úÖ Same data cleaning steps
- ‚úÖ Same feature scaling

## Files Modified
- ‚úÖ `app.py` - Fixed `process_uploaded_data()` function
- üìÑ `formula_comparison.py` - Shows the differences
- üìÑ `PREDICTION_FIX.md` - This documentation

**Status: ‚úÖ FIXED** - Predictions should now be accurate!
