The formulas were COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!

This explains why predictions were inaccurate:
- Academic scores were off by ~40 points
- Engagement scores were off by ~9 points  
- Risk indicators had different thresholds

The model was trained with the NEW (correct) formulas from preprocess.py,
but app.py was using the OLD (wrong) formulas during prediction.

‚úÖ NOW FIXED: app.py uses the exact same formulas as preprocess.py
